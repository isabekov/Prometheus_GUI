Prometheus is a QT-based GUI for fireprog.exe

To compile for Linux, run:
     make Prometheus_Linux

To cross-compile for Windows on Linux using MXE (a cross-compilation environment based on MinGW), run:
     make Prometheus_MinGW32.exe
     make Prometheus_MinGW64.exe

Assumption is that MXE is located in "/opt/mxe/" folder. Compiled executables will be stored in "release" directory.
